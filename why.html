          The need for meshnet arises from the fact that how we connect and form the network around us today. Let us try to understand in simpler terms.
        </p>
        
        <div id="how-we-connect">
          <h3>How do we connect today?</h3>
          <p>
            To get connected to Internet, today we go and approach an organization called Internet Service Provider (ISP). In India examples of ISPs are,
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>BSNL</li>
            <li>Airtel</li>
            <li>ACT Broadband</li>
            <li>List of more ISPs in India can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_internet_service_providers_in_India" target="_blank">here</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>The ISPs gives us data plans to choose and once we confirm the plan, they will extend a wire (or) cable (if it is a wired broadband connection) or they will setup a wireless transceiver at the top of the building (if it is a wireless connection). Different ISPs have inter-connection between each other, so even if you have a connection from BSNL and if your friend have a connection from Airtel, you both can still communicate. The image below is a representation of this description.
          </p>
          <p class="scenario">
           Let us consider a scenario where two persons (Karthick &amp; Kavitha) who lives in the same street wants to chat with each other and they both are connected to different ISPs. Let us see what happens when they both use Facebook Messenger or similar application like Whatsapp (or) Telegram to chat. Karthick sends a message to Kavitha.
          </p>

          <ol class="scenario">
              <li>Message leaves Karthick's Phone.</li>
              <li>Message reaches Karthick's Internet Service Provider.</li>
              <li>ISP of Karthick finds the route to reach Whatsapp's server which is located outside the country.</li>
              <li>The Whatsapp server now sends the message from it's server to it's ISP.</li>
              <li>The ISP of Whatsapp finds the location of Kavitha's ISP and passes the message there.</li>
              <li>Kavitha's ISP finally passes the message to Kavitha that was sent by Karthick.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The above scenario is very well shown in the picture below. Follow the green line to understand how the message flows from one machine to another. In practical, there will be more number of Intermediate devices which will also carry the message from one device to another, for simplicity we have just considered the end devices and intermediate servers.</p>

        <div id="probelm">
          <h3>So what is the problem here?</h3>
          <p>
            We saw how the message from Karthick reaches Kavitha. Message from Kavitha to Karthick will also flow in similar way. Let us ask ourselves some questions here,
          </p>
          <ol class="scenario">
              <li>What will happen if the ISP of Karthick or Kavitha is down (i.e no signal)?</li>
              <li>What will happen if the Whatsapp server is down (i.e server is not running)?</li>
              <li>What if the ISP of Karthick or Kavitha is reading what Karthick and Kavitha are chatting about?</li>
              <li>What if the Server (or) the ISPs are not passing the message to others?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There can be two possible answers for the above questions.
          </p>
          <ul class="scenario">
              <li>No one connected to the ISP can chat with each other because ISP is down or the server is down or the message is blocked intentionally.</li>
              <li>It is not safe to chat when the ISP or the Whatsapp server is spying on the messages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If there is one point in the network due to which no one is able to communicate when it goes down is called <strong>Single Point of Failure</strong>. Here in our case there are two such points. One is ISP and the other is the Whatsapp server. If the ISP or the server blocks the communication intentionally, we call this as <strong>Censorship</strong>. If the ISP or the server spies on everyone either for-profit (or) on the behalf of the public or private organizations, we call this as <strong>Mass Surveillance</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
          <em>Note</em>: We have chosen <strong>Whatsapp</strong> for demonstration purpose. The problems identified above are applicable not only for Whatsapp, but for every applications that works in a similar way.

      <div>
        <div id="what">
          <h3>What is the way forward?</h3>
          <p>
          The above problems identified are not only serious, but if you ask a Network Engineer, they would explain you how the above problems are violating the basic principles of a network. The way forward from here is to connect differently in such a way that there are no single point of failures to avoid disconnection. No single point of failure also means no single point of control and thus no censorship. Surveillance is still a problem, but it cannot happen at the same scale as before. In order to prevent mass surveillance, all applications on the network should adopt encryption and decryption techniques, thus messages can be understood only by sender and the receiver.
